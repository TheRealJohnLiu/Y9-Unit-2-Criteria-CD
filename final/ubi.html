              <br>
              <p class="lead"><center>UBI stands for Universal Basic Income and refers to regular payments of cash to the population. Very little or no requirements to recieve this money so that everyone can increase their income. Hence, "Universal". Basicly, just free money for everyone. This is just the general idea of it but lots of people have debates and disagreements about what UBI actually entails. Things like whether UBI should replace welfare completely or should exist with welfare. Other things like how often it should be distributed or should it be to each household or to each individual. There are extensions of it like MBI, Minimum Basic Income where the government gives everyone just enough to get above the poverty line.</center></p>

              <h1 class="display-4"><center>What are Some of the Benefits?</center></h1>
              <br>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Ending Poverty</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>Advocates for UBI believe the in countries that are generally richer, UBI would bring its citzens above the poverty line, and therefore, no poverty anymore.</center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Fighting Technological Unemployment</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>More and more jobs are being lost with the quickening research of AI and robots, and advanced technology. UBI would basicly be some sort of security net for the millions of people who would lose jobs because of this. Research has found out, that the longer a person is unemployed, the harder and longer it takes for them to find a new job. With UBI, it would give these jobless people, a small source of income to help them get back onto their feet and find a job faster. </center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Supporting Unpaid Care Workers</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>People who often has an ill or, disabled in some way, relative, often have to quite their jobs in order to fully take care of them. UBI would allow them to get a source of income and support themselves. Relieving the pressure on public services.</center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Expanding the Middle Class and Ending Poverty</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>The rapid economic growth in high income countries is only making the rich people richer and doesn't have much effect towards the working class. Research from economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty showed that "the bottom half of earners went from making 20 percent of overall income in 1979 to just 13 percent in 2014. The top 1 percent, on the other hand, have gone from making 11 percent to 20 percent. The pie has gotten vastly bigger, and the richest families have reaped bigger and bigger pieces from it". UBI would help to balance this inequality and expand the shrinking middle class.</center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>No Need For Social Security</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>The government has lots of organizations where they help those in poverty with things like food stamps and subsidized housing, etc. But with UBI, there will no longer be a need for them and would cut a country's spending by eliminating these organizations.</center></p> 
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Overall?</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>Successful implementation of UBI would mean improvements in food security, stress, mental health, physical health, housing, education, and employment.</center></p>

              <h1 class="display-4"><center>What are Some of the Potential Drawbacks of UBI</center></h1>
              <br>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Motivation to Work</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>Since UBI basicaly gives out free money, the biggest concern people have is that workers will stop working. Because they don't need to work anymore as they have UBI. With less people working means less income tax.</center></p>            </div>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Cost</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>The cost of this program will be costly. The estimated amount for the implementation of UBI is around 3.9 trillion dollars! Even though UBI would take pressure off of other things like social security institutions. It is still an enourmous budget for the government.</center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Inequality</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>Some people are concerned that if it is really fair to give the same amount of money to people like Bill Gates. Would and Does Bill Gates even need this money? Some believe that certain conditions should be met before you can recieve this money.</center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center><b>Philosophical Counterarguments</b></center></p>
              <p class="lead"><center>"Is money a birthright?" Capitalist countries are built on the ideological foundation that money is something we earn. UBI would completely change this. Some believe that community service should be a requirement for receiving UBI.</center></p>

              <br>
              <p class="lead"><center>UBi would eliminate poverty by giving everyone enough money to either end up above the poverty line and/or be able to easier find a job or a better job so that they dont become even poorer.</center></p>

              <p class="lead"><center>UBI may well be implemented in the near future, the next few decades and it will impact you as it is "Universal." This is important to you because now, will be able to know what its gonna entail and going to be able to be ready for it.  </center></p>
